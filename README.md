# SCOVE_Web

Smart CoVID Entrance IoT Project (Web Application)

A smart entrance device that detects temperature of the subject (face detection and temperature sensing) and whether he has worn mask or not (mask detection), then allows entry based on whether his face qualifies for entrance or not (face recognition). This is a part of the group project for the course CS698T (Intoduction to Internet of Things and Its Industrial Applications) taught by Dr. Priyanka Bagade at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in the fall of 2021 (2021-22-1).

This repository is just one part of the complete project. The other repository [SCOVE_Node](https://github.com/Ishanh2000/SCOVE_Node) are nodes which communicate with this web-app.
